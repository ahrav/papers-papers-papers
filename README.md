# Papers, Papers, Papers ðŸ“š

This repository is a personal collection of research papers I've read over time, primarily related to software engineering.
The goal is to track and organize my reading journey.

## Inspiration

Many of the papers listed here are sourced from the amazing [papers-we-love](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love) repository.
Huge credit to the maintainers and contributors of that project for curating such a fantastic collection of influential papers.
